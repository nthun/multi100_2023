-------------------------------

This is the single-trace claim selected from this paper in Phase 1. It
includes two levels of claim 3: 3a, a statement of the finding, and 3b,
the specification of the test. In bushel-trace claims, claim 3b is not
coded, and claim 3 is analagous to the single-trace 3a.

-   **Claim 2 (Abstract statement):** The disadvantage in psychological
    well-being of childless people is smaller in countries with tolerant
    norms towards childlessness and high levels of social contacts.

-   **Claim 3a (Finding statement):** In countries with tolerant norms
    towards childlessness or high levels of social contacts, the
    association between childlessness and psychological well-being is
    weaker for men, and even positive for women.

-   **Claim 3b (Test specification):** The authors used linear
    multilevel analyses to test their hypotheses. The results of
    analyses including cross-level interactions between country
    characteristics and people’s parental status are presented in Table
    4 (outcome variable is psychological well-being). Note that these
    models were not only adjusted for the individual-level controls, but
    also for individual social contacts and norms towards childlessness
    (parameters not shown). The analysis selected, which tests part of
    the claim, is Model 2a for men. The selected term is ‘Lives with
    children x Percent (strongly) disapproves’ (see ‘Men’ panel of Model
    2a in Table 4 for details).

-   **Claim 4 (Results statement):** In Model 2a, the authors find that
    the difference in psychological well-being between people who live
    with children and childless people is larger as societal norms are
    more disapproving of childlessness (from ‘Men’ panel of Model 2a in
    Table 4, ‘Lives with children x Percent (strongly) disapproves’
    term: B = 0.002; SE = 0.001; P &lt; 0.05).

There are 6 bushel-trace claims available from this paper (4 focal).

### Trace number: 1 / Claim ID: 5oz6x8

Focal: True

Contains equivalent test from Phase 1 claim: False

-   **Claim 2 (Abstract statement):** Using multilevel regression
    analyses, we found that the extent to which childlessness is
    associated with worse psychological well-being differs between
    European societies, especially among women

-   **Claim 3 (Finding statement):** Second, we ask to what extent the
    nature and strength of the relationship between childlessness and
    psychological well-being vary across 24 European countries.

-   **Claim 4 (Result statement):** Figure 1 shows how the relationship
    between childlessness and psychological well-being varies across
    countries…The figures show that…for men…there is considerable
    cross-national variation in the extent to which childlessness is
    associated with worse psychological well-being. With only few
    exceptions, men who either live with their children or whose
    children have left the parental home are in better psychological
    well-being than childless people. \[Figure 1, Men, for men…there is
    considerable cross-national variation in the extent to which
    childlessness is associated with worse psychological well-being\]

-   **Statistical evidence:** Figure 1, Men, for men…there is
    considerable cross-national variation in the extent to which
    childlessness is associated with worse psychological well-being

### Trace number: 2 / Claim ID: ywpnj6

Focal: True

Contains equivalent test from Phase 1 claim: False

-   **Claim 2 (Abstract statement):** Using multilevel regression
    analyses, we found that the extent to which childlessness is
    associated with worse psychological well-being differs between
    European societies, especially among women

-   **Claim 3 (Finding statement):** Second, we ask to what extent the
    nature and strength of the relationship between childlessness and
    psychological well-being vary across 24 European countries.

-   **Claim 4 (Result statement):** Figure 1 shows how the relationship
    between childlessness and psychological well-being varies across
    countries…The figures show that…for…women, there is considerable
    cross-national variation in the extent to which childlessness is
    associated with worse psychological well-being…Interestingly, Figure
    1 reveals that the fact that no significant overall association
    between childlessness and psychological well-being was found for
    women might be caused by the association being negative in some
    countries, but positive in others. In half of the countries,
    childless women actually report better psychological well-being than
    women with children. \[Figure 1, Women, for…women, there is
    considerable cross-national variation in the extent to which
    childlessness is associated with worse psychological well-being\]

-   **Statistical evidence:** Figure 1, Women, for…women, there is
    considerable cross-national variation in the extent to which
    childlessness is associated with worse psychological well-being

### Trace number: 3 / Claim ID: 21drv2

Focal: False

Contains equivalent test from Phase 1 claim: True

-   **Claim 2 (Abstract statement):** The disadvan- tage in
    psychological well-being of childless people is smaller in countries
    with | tolerant norms towards childlessness

-   **Claim 3 (Finding statement):** Second, we hypothesize that this
    negative association is stronger as more people at the national
    level disapprove of being childless (H2).

-   **Claim 4 (Result statement):** The next step is to examine the role
    of social contacts and societal norms in causing this variation. The
    results of analyses including cross-level interactions between these
    country characteristics and people’s parental status are presented
    in Table 4…In Model 2a, we find that (for…men…) the difference in
    psychological well-being between people who live with children and
    childless people is larger as societal norms are more disapproving
    of childlessness. \[Table 4, Model 2a, Men, Lives with children x
    Percent (strongly) disapproves: B = 0.002, SE = 0.001, P&lt;0.05\]

### Trace number: 5 / Claim ID: oko481

Focal: True

Contains equivalent test from Phase 1 claim: False

-   **Claim 2 (Abstract statement):** The disadvan- tage in
    psychological well-being of childless people is smaller in countries
    with | high levels of social contacts

-   **Claim 3 (Finding statement):** Finally, our third hypothesis reads
    that the association is weaker as there is a higher degree of social
    contacts at the national level (H3).

-   **Claim 4 (Result statement):** The next step is to examine the role
    of social contacts and societal norms in causing this variation. The
    results of analyses including cross-level interactions between these
    country characteristics and people’s parental status are presented
    in Table 4…In Model 2b…For women…we do find significant interaction
    effects: as compared with both groups of people with children, the
    disadvantage of the childless with regard to their psychological
    well-being is weaker if the level of social contacts is higher.

    contacts: B = -0.122, SE = 0.036, P&lt;0.01\]
